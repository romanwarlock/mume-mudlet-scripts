Corrupted, Evil Ent
Location: East Mirkwood

NB! reward cannot be combined with growth (Harle) and vigour (Poison forest) effects

Before starting the quest, obtain a black heart and a shard of black ice: do yourself or get from any player.
Both items are from Central Anduin: kill and butcher the frayed fell beast for a black heart and a cloud of black, icy shards for a shard.

Go to East Mirkwood to area around Centre of the Twisted Woods and kill oaks and a darkly gnarled tree.

Do not kill next gnarled tree because it's the quest mob, who summons more oaks and vines. If you get hit by gnarled flee and do oaks and vines.
After that give one by one a black heart and a shard of black ice to a gnarled tree and get rewarded. Finally, kill it for experience.

Reward: +6 dodge bonus for a week
