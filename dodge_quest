Corrupted, Evil Ent
Location: East Mirkwood around Centre of the Twisted Woods

NB! reward cannot be combined with growth (Harle) and vigour (Poison forest) effects

After you have obtained a black heard and black shards of ice come here and start killing oaks and a darkly gnarled tree.

Do not kill next gnarled because it's the quest mob, who summons oaks and vines. If you get hit by gnarled flee and do oaks and vines.
After that give one by one a black heart and a shard of black ice to a gnarled tree and get rewarded. After that, kill it for experience.

Reward: +6 dodge bonus for a week
