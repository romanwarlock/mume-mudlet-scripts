You stand before the great worm Mithnaur, one of the great drakes bred during
the first age of the sun by Morgoth himself. Known to men as Crackmar the Grey,
this huge lizard is one of the few winged dragons to still live. Dull in colour
when compared to some other fire-breathing drakes, within the confines of this
cavern, the beast's body of thick hardened scales seems to fade into the stone.
A coiled tail, over one hundred feet in length, snakes across the floor,
disappearing into the gloom. Large, leathery wings spread throughout the cave
as he towers above you, tongues of fire flickering from his nostrils. When you
gaze at the great jaws filled with teeth, and the great claws as large as a man
you are left in no doubt that this is truly a monster in all proportions.
Mithnaur the Dragon is in awful condition.
