This Morgundul orc looks different from the others. He is shorter and
dressed
in long ragged robes instead of armour. His head is bald and covered
in
tattoos, but he does not look old. He observes the world around him
with great
care, but his unusually tranquil and silent demeanour could be masking
a
violent and cruel nature.
A bald orc is in an excellent condition.
