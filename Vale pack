Location: Anduin Vale
Quest: Pretty hard
In winter when full moon rises over the Anduin Vale, the orkish raiders
on great black wargs and their chief will raid the village west of
Ingrove. Those raiders will kill everything on their way as they are
heading for party. You, as a mighty hero or legend, must kill the warg
chief, butcher its corpse and  bring the head to Beorn (in human form),
who will drop the head on the ground and stomp fiercely, then tear it
apart, saying 'Ah! Killed the Warg Chief! Killed the Warg Chief!' and
give you a sealed letter for Loyen the chieftain of Ingrove. If you've
lost citizenship prevously, Loryen will ask you for a donation. Say
'citizen' to find out the price.
NB! Darkies can come with the pack.

'Flocks of birds can be seen high above, fleeing from an unknown peril.'
This is the message at night when the pack pops, it is the moonrise at 6
pm (2nd night to enter DK).
Pack itself pops near noc-roots and slowly goes down the road to the
village.
